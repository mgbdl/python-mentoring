Django - Challenge Task
* Add a new model called User
* It should have these fields:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email
* Make sure to make the migrations!
* Then create a script that will populate your database with fake Users.
* Then confirm the population through the Admin interface
* Then create a view for your website for the domain extension /users
* This /users page will be an HTML list of the user names and email
* You will use template tags to generate this content from the User Model
* Remember to change your urls.py files  to deal with the changes to the /users extension!
